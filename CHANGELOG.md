GearScoreLite TBC Edition - Changelog
======================================

Version 4.0.4-TBC (T4/T5 Scoring Fix)
-------------------------------------
CRITICAL FIX:
- ðŸ”§ **FIXED: T4/T5 Scoring Inversion Issue**
  * Extended T4 item level range from 110-120 to 110-127
  * Resolves issue where T5 items (Nordrassil Chestguard, ilvl 133) scored lower than T4 items (Chestguard of Malorne, ilvl 120)
  * Items at ilvl 120-127 now properly assigned to T4 tier instead of falling between T4 and T5
  * Ensures proper scoring progression: T5 items now consistently score higher than T4 items
- ðŸ“‹ **UPDATED: Documentation**
  * All files updated to reflect corrected T4 range (110-127)
  * README.md, README-TBC.txt, and formula comments synchronized

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- **Root Cause**: Gap between T4 (110-119) and T5 (128+) caused ilvl 120-127 items to be improperly categorized
- **Solution**: Extended T4 upper bound to ilvl 127 to eliminate scoring gap
- **Impact**: Proper tier assignment ensures accurate relative scoring between T4 and T5 items
