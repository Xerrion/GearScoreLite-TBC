GearScoreLite TBC Edition
========================

Original Authors: Mirrikat45, dyzcypul
TBC Adaptation: Xerrion

This is a specialized version of GearScoreLite optimized specifically for TBC content running on WotLK client (3.3.5a).

WHAT'S FIXED:
- TBC Best in Slot items now score appropriately instead of being undervalued
- Three-tier scoring system for TBC content progression (T4/Heroic → T5/T6 → Sunwell)
- Removed WotLK-specific features not relevant to TBC gameplay

SCORING TIERS:
- TBC_LOW (85-99 ilvl): T4 raids, Heroic dungeons, Karazhan
- TBC (100-133 ilvl): T5 raids (Serpentshrine, Tempest Keep)
- TBC_T6 (120-140 ilvl): T6 raids (Black Temple, Mount Hyjal)
- TBC_HIGH (141-151 ilvl): Sunwell Plateau, premium items

USAGE:
- Same commands as original: /gs, /gset, or /gearscore
- Mouse over players to see their gear score
- Item tooltips show individual item scores
- Character sheet displays your current gear score

COMPATIBILITY:
- Works on TBC content servers using WotLK client (3.3.5a)
- Maintains all original functionality
- No additional setup required

This adaptation ensures TBC items are scored according to their actual power level within TBC content, rather than being penalized by WotLK-centric scoring algorithms.
