GearScoreLite TBC Edition
========================

Original Authors: Mirrikat45, dyzcypul
TBC Adaptation: Xerrion

This is a specialized version of GearScoreLite optimized specifically for TBC content running on WotLK client (3.3.5a).

WHAT'S FIXED:
- TBC Best in Slot items now score appropriately instead of being undervalued
- Six-tier scoring system for TBC content progression phases
- Removed WotLK-specific features not relevant to TBC gameplay

SCORING TIERS:
- TBC_SUNWELL (154-164 ilvl): Phase 5: Sunwell Plateau T6.5
- TBC_T6 (141-151 ilvl): Phase 3: Mount Hyjal, Black Temple T6
- TBC_T5 (128-141 ilvl): Phase 2: SSC, Tempest Keep T5 + Phase 4: Zul'Aman, Badge Gear
- TBC_T4 (110-120 ilvl): Phase 1: Karazhan, Gruul, Magtheridon T4
- TBC_PRE_RAID (105-115 ilvl): Pre-Raid: Heroics, Crafted, Reputations
- Formula "B" (<105 ilvl): Pre-TBC content

USAGE:
- Same commands as original: /gs, /gset, or /gearscore
- Mouse over players to see their gear score
- Item tooltips show individual item scores
- Character sheet displays your current gear score

COMPATIBILITY:
- Works on TBC content servers using WotLK client (3.3.5a)
- Maintains all original functionality
- No additional setup required

This adaptation ensures TBC items are scored according to their actual power level within TBC content, rather than being penalized by WotLK-centric scoring algorithms.
